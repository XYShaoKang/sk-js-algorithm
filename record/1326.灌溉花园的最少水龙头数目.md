 * [1326] 灌溉花园的最少水龙头数目
 */
function minTaps(n: number, a: number[]): number {}
// @lc code=start
// @lc code=end
```

## 解法 1: 动态规划

ranges[i] 只有 100 可以直接枚举

```ts
function minTaps(n: number, ranges: number[]): number {
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity)
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!ranges[i]) continue
    let start = Math.max(0, i - ranges[i])
    for (let j = start; j <= Math.min(n, i + ranges[i]); j++) {
      if (i - ranges[i] > 0) {
        dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[i - ranges[i]] + 1)
      } else {
        dp[j] = 1
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[n]
}
```

## 解法 2: 双指针

```ts
function minTaps(n: number, a: number[]): number {
  const next: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(-Infinity)
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    const l = Math.max(0, i - a[i]),
      r = Math.min(n, i + a[i])
    next[l] = Math.max(next[l], r)
  }

  if (next[0] === -Infinity) return -1
  if (next[0] === n) return 1

  let res = 1,
    r = next[0]
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; ) {
    let tmp = i,
      j = i
    res++
    while (j <= r) {
      if (next[j] === n) return res
      tmp = Math.max(tmp, next[j++])
    }
    if (tmp === i) return -1
    i = j
    r = tmp
  }
}
```

## 解法 3: 线段树

如果有最小化线段树的板子，也可以直接用线段树来解，很大程度上可以降低思维难度

```ts
function minTaps(n: number, a: number[]): number {
  const segTree = new SegTree(n + 10)
  let res = Infinity
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    if (!a[i]) continue
    let ans = Infinity
    if (i - a[i] <= 0) {
      segTree.update(0, i + a[i], 1)
      ans = 1
    } else {
      const min = segTree.query(i - a[i], i + a[i])
      ans = min + 1
      segTree.update(i - a[i], i + a[i], ans)
    }

    if (i + a[i] >= n) res = Math.min(res, ans)
  }
  return res === Infinity ? -1 : res
}

    else if (x > mid) this._update(node.right, mid + 1, r, x, y, z)
    else this._update(node.left, l, mid, x, mid, z), this._update(node.right, mid + 1, r, mid + 1, y, z)

    this._up(node)
  }
